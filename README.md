# Scandiweb entry test

## How to start
1. Follow the "How to start" steps mentioned [here](https://github.com/scandiweb/junior-react-endpoint)
2. Make sure the server is ready at this address: http://localhost:4000/
3. Download this repo's code
4. Install dependencies
5. Run "npm start"

## Important points
- Make sure the screen width is at least 1250px
- The buttons with the labels "ORDER" and "CHECKOUT" don't do anything 
- The arrows on the image that has more than one image don't do anything; they are there to indicate that the product has more than one image when viewed using the cart page or mini-cart display section
- If an item is added from PLP before visiting its PDP, the first values of each attribute of that item, if any, are used as default values
- Clicking on the product card displayed on the PLP takes you to the PDP of the clicked product
- The application won't allow setting the item's quantity value to some value less than 1
